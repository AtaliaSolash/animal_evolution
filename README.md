# Siamese Evolution: Learning Animal Similarity from Craniofacial Images

This repository contains the code and dataset preparation scripts for the prject “Siamese Evolution: Learning Animal Similarity from Craniofacial Images.” The project explores evolutionary similarity by analyzing craniofacial features of animals through Siamese network architectures with CLIP backbones.

**Overview**:
Goal: Learn a similarity metric between pairs of animal head images to reflect evolutionary relationships.
Architecture: Siamese Network with frozen CLIP backbones (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14, RN50).
Explainability: Grad-CAM used to visualize model focus.
Dataset: 452 images curated from web crawlers and iNaturalist (4 families: Felidae, Caninae, Bovidae, Cervidae).
